rbac:
  # Specifies whether RBAC resources should be created
  create: true

  # Specifies whether cluster-admin ClusterRole will be used for dashboard
  # ServiceAccount (NOT RECOMMENDED).
  # development only
  clusterAdminRole: true

  # Start in ReadOnly mode.
  # Only dashboard-related Secrets and ConfigMaps will still be available for writing.
  #
  # Turn OFF clusterAdminRole to use clusterReadOnlyRole.
  #
  # The basic idea of the clusterReadOnlyRole comparing to the clusterAdminRole
  # is not to hide all the secrets and sensitive data but more
  # to avoid accidental changes in the cluster outside the standard CI/CD.
  #
  # Same as for clusterAdminRole, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use this version in production.
  # Instead you should review the role and remove all potentially sensitive parts such as
  # access to persistentvolumes, pods/log etc.
  clusterReadOnlyRole: false

serviceAccount:
  # Specifies whether a service account should be created
  create: true
  # The name of the service account to use.
  # If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template
  name: kubernetes-dashboard-admin
